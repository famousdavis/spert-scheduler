/**
 * The app hands users static files out of `public/` — three guide PDFs (Quick
 * Reference, Import Quick Reference, Connect AI), the activity-import CSV
 * template, and the favicon. Nothing holds the link and the file together: rename or drop one of
 * them and the build passes, ESLint passes, every type check passes, and the
 * link 404s in the user's face.
 *
 * This walks the source for root-relative asset references and asserts each one
 * resolves. It is deliberately a source scan rather than a component render, so
 * it covers every link in the app rather than only the ones a test happens to
 * mount.
 *
 * Only root-relative literals are checked. External URLs — the ToS and Privacy
 * PDFs are served from spertsuite.com — are out of scope, because asserting on
 * them here would make this suite depend on another repository's deploy.
