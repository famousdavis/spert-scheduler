 * The dashboard toolbar's icon paths — Export All, Import, Load Sample, New Project — copied exactly

 * SPERT® Suite app shows the same four icons. Drawn by `ToolbarIcon`.
 *
 * In a file of their own, not beside the component: a `.tsx` exporting a constant and a component
 * trips `react-refresh/only-export-components`.
